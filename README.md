<h3>Code Overview</h3>

* For the full algorithm for polynomial decomposition, run <b><u>train10.py</u></b>. All the previous training files are
  development
  versions that led to the product that is presented in train.10.py.

* <b><u>train11.py</u></b> check the decomposition of polynomial that came from a composition of two polynomials. It is
  a test
  file that checks the decomposition of polynomials, with different degrees than those of the composed polynomials.

* <b><u>train12.py</u></b> check the decomposition for extremely large polynomials. Its seems like it gets pretty close.
  I believe it is the aggressive regularization on the largest coefficient that enforces it.

* <b><u>train13.py</u></b> try to decompose random polynomials with random coefficients.
